We're pinning gatsby to 2.17.11 in this test because gatsby had a bug
in their plugin resolution mechanism that broke
gatsby deployments.
(see https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/19150).

The test was fixed in 2.17.12 but we're keeping this test
to make sure we don't break gatsby deployments for these older versions.

This test makes sure gatsby >=2.17.7 and <=2.17.11 are working.
