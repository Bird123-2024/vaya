# Not authorized to access domain

#### Why This Error Occurred

You tried to add or update domain data, but you don't have access to the domain.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

If you/your team owns the domain you are most likely in the wrong context. Use `now switch` to select the team or user that owns the domain.
